# Network Best Practices

This document outlines the fundamental best practices for designing, deploying, and maintaining secure and reliable network infrastructure within Sky Genesis Enterprise.

---

## 1. Network Segmentation

- Divide the network into distinct segments (e.g., by department, function, or security level) to limit broadcast domains and contain security incidents.
- Use VLANs and firewalls to enforce segmentation and control traffic flow.

---

## 2. IP Addressing Scheme

- Implement a clear and consistent IP addressing plan.
- Use private IP ranges (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16) for internal networks.
- Assign subnets logically to reflect organizational structure.

---

## 3. Secure Network Access

- Require authentication for all network devices and management interfaces.
- Use encrypted protocols (SSH, TLS) instead of unsecured ones (Telnet, HTTP).

---

## 4. Firewall and Perimeter Security

- Deploy firewalls at network boundaries and between segments.
- Use multi-layered firewalls to enforce defense-in-depth.
- Regularly update firewall rules and monitor logs for suspicious activity.

---

## 5. VPN and Remote Access

- Use VPNs with strong encryption to secure remote connections.
- Enforce multi-factor authentication for VPN access.
- Limit VPN access to only necessary resources.

---

## 6. Monitoring and Logging

- Implement continuous network monitoring and alerting.
- Collect and analyze logs from routers, switches, firewalls, and other critical devices.
- Use IDS/IPS systems to detect and prevent intrusions.

---

## 7. Redundancy and High Availability

- Design networks with redundant paths and devices to avoid single points of failure.
- Use load balancing and failover mechanisms where applicable.

---

## 8. Regular Updates and Patch Management

- Keep network device firmware and software up to date.
- Schedule regular maintenance windows for updates and configuration backups.

---

## 9. Documentation

- Maintain detailed network diagrams, configurations, and change logs.
- Document all network policies and procedures clearly.

---

## 10. Configuring Network on Linux with `/etc/network/interfaces`

For Debian-based Linux distributions, network interfaces can be configured via the `/etc/network/interfaces` file. Here is a basic example to set a static IP address:

```bash
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
    address 10.1.0.100
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 10.1.0.1
    dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
```

* `auto eth0` : Automatically bring up interface `eth0` on boot.
* `iface eth0 inet static` : Defines `eth0` as a static IPv4 interface.
* `address` : The static IP address to assign.
* `netmask` : Subnet mask for the network.
* `gateway` : Default gateway IP.
* `dns-nameservers` : DNS servers for name resolution.

To apply changes, run:

```bash
sudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0
```

Or reboot the system.

For DHCP configuration, the file would contain:

```bash
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
```
