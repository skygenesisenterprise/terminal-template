# Password Best Practices

Strong password management is essential to safeguard our systems and data. This document outlines the recommended guidelines for creating, storing, and managing passwords within the company.

## 1. Use Strong and Unique Passwords

- Passwords should be **at least 30 characters long**.
- Use a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Avoid common words, phrases, or easily guessable information (e.g., birthdays, names).

## 2. Use a Password Manager

- Use company-approved password managers (e.g., Bitwarden on-premise) to generate and store complex passwords securely.
- Never store passwords in plain text files or unsecured locations.
- Share passwords only via secure channels within the password manager.

---

## 3. Avoid Password Reuse

- Never reuse passwords across multiple accounts or systems.
- Each service or device must have a unique password.

---

## 4. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- Whenever possible, enable MFA to add an extra layer of security.
- Use hardware tokens, authentication apps, or SMS-based codes as applicable.

---

## 5. Regularly Update Passwords

- Change critical passwords every 90 days or sooner if a compromise is suspected.
- Revoke access immediately when an employee leaves or changes roles.

---

## 6. Protect Password Confidentiality

- Never share your passwords via email or unsecured messaging.
- Be cautious of phishing attempts requesting your credentials.

## 7. Password Reset Procedures

- Use secure password reset mechanisms requiring identity verification.
- Avoid temporary passwords that are weak or easily guessable.
