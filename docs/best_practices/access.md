# Access Management Best Practices

Proper access control is critical to ensure the security and integrity of our systems and data. This document outlines the guidelines for granting, managing, and revoking access within the company.

---

## 1. Principle of Least Privilege

- Users should be granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job functions.
- Avoid giving unnecessary administrative or elevated privileges.

---

## 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Access rights should be assigned based on user roles within the organization.
- Regularly review and update roles to reflect organizational changes.

---

## 3. Access Approval and Documentation

- All access requests must be formally approved by the relevant manager or system owner.
- Maintain a record of granted accesses for auditing purposes.

---

## 4. Authentication Methods

- Use strong authentication mechanisms, preferably multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Avoid sharing accounts; each user must have a unique login.

---

## 5. Temporary Access

- Provide temporary access only when necessary and limit its duration.
- Automatically revoke temporary access after the defined period.

---

## 6. Account Monitoring and Review

- Periodically review user accounts and access levels to detect and remove unnecessary privileges.
- Disable or remove accounts promptly when employees leave or change roles.

---

## 7. Remote Access

- Use secure VPNs or other encrypted channels for remote access.
- Enforce strict authentication and monitoring for remote connections.

---

## 8. Incident Response

- Immediately report and respond to any unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activities.

**By following these access management principles, we ensure the security and proper governance of our information systems.**
